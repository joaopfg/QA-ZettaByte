# InferSent

*InferSent* was used as a *sentence embedding* method that provides semantic representations for English sentences. It is trained on natural language inference data and generalizes well to many different tasks.
To run the project it is necessary having the GloVe vector embedding inside a folder named *GloVe* which must be inside the main folder. It's also necessary having the pre-trained model (*infersent1.pkl*) in a folder named *encoder* which must be inside the main folder. To check how to get those files, please check the [original InferSent repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent) .
  

# Tika

*Tika* was used to grab text from .pdf files. It also gives a support to many others files formats.
For more informations, see the [original Tika repository](https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python) .
